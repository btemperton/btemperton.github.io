  description: "Ben received his Ph.D in Microbiology from [Queen's University Belfast](https://www.qub.ac.uk/) in 2011, working on how marine microbes store phosphate as polyphosphate, particularly in oligotrophic environments.

  Fascinated by microbes with tiny genomes, Ben did his postdoc in [Steve Giovannoni's](https://microbiology.science.oregonstate.edu/dr-stephen-giovannoni) lab, using metaproteomics, single-cell genomics and metagenomics to evaluate functional and taxonomic diversity of the Pelagibacter. During this time, he was involved in the discovery of the pelagiphages, most abundant viruses on Earth, and fell in love with phage biology.

  After a second postdoc at Plymouth Marine Laboratory, where he established the UK's first Environmental Single cell genomics centre, Ben moved to Exeter as a Lecturer in Bioinformatics in September 2015. There, he established a group to investigate host-virus interactions in organisms with streamlined genomes, coupling viral metagenomics with high-throughput culturing of fastidious bacteria and their phages."
